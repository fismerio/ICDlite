  # I C D lite
  A social search engine that includes incentives for people to enter rare interests. The points earned during the entry 
  of the information can be used to reveal matches. Matches are listed as percentages of interests in common.
  The more rare the interest, the more points the participant gets.
  
  A monitored structured chat also allows for extra points as incentives for "interesting" conversations.
